# Hyderabad-GitHub-Users

## Overview
This project gathers and analyzes GitHub user and repository data from Hyderabad for users with over 50 followers. The data provides insights into user activity, popularity, and engagement metrics, which may be useful for developers, recruiters, and data analysts interested in developer communities.

### 1.  This project used the GitHub API to gather data on users from Hyderabad with over 50 followers, focusing on user profiles and repository details.
### 2. Surprisingly, a significant number of active developers have not enabled the projects or wiki features in their repositories, possibly missing out on collaboration opportunities.
### 3.  Developers should consider enabling both the projects and wiki features in their repositories to boost collaboration and showcase project management skills.

### Files Included
1. users.csv: Contains detailed user information, including username, company, location, follower count, and more.
2. repositories.csv: Lists up to 500 recent repositories per user, with fields such as repository name, star count, programming language, and licensing information.
3. README.md: Project overview and main findings.

### Key Findings:
* User Activity Patterns: Users who joined GitHub after 2020 are predominantly working with popular languages like JavaScript and Python.
* Top Companies and Languages: Many developers are associated with popular tech companies, and languages like JavaScript, Python, and Java dominate the repositories.
* Followers and Repositories: Users with more repositories tend to have more followers, suggesting that active project work may attract a larger audience.

### Methodology:
Data was collected using the GitHub API by querying users and repositories based on location and follower count. The data was cleaned and processed in CSV format for easy analysis and visualization.

### Recommendations:
1. For Recruiters: Focus on developers with strong follower-to-following ratios ("leader strength") as they may be influential or highly regarded within the community.
2. For Developers: To increase visibility, maintaining a clear bio, enabling collaboration features, and focusing on quality repository work are effective ways to build a stronger GitHub presence.
